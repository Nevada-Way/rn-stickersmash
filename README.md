# Welcome to tutorial app StickerSmash from Expo docs ðŸ‘‹

Link : https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. I modified the app regarding routing and styling just to get the feel.

4. TODO:  
   I may return to this one daybut for now (April 03 2025) I will move on to other tutorials.
